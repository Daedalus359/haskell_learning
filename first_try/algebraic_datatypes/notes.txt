Bool is a type constant because it is a fully defined type unto itself.

[] is a type constructor but not a type constant, because it needs to be paired with an argument before it fully defines a type.

Query the "Kind signature" of a type constructor in GHCI with :k
Prelude> :k []
[] :: * -> * --this means that it must be applied to a type before it results in a type

Tuples are anonymous product types

Newtype gets a unary type constructor but adds not runtime overhead unlike data

newtype also allows you to add typeclass instances to whatever type it includes

if you want to *automatically derive* *custom* typeclass instances on your newtypes, compile with the {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} pragma

record syntax creates functions that go from the type they are a part of to the field in question
